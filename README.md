# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected rendering and validation issues. The `bug.html` file contains the error, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected version.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected layout or rendering behavior due to the missing closing tag.

## How to fix the bug
Ensure all HTML tags are properly closed.  The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct usage of the `<p>` tag with a matching closing tag (`</p>`).
